# Portfolio website

As a web developer I took in mind that having a porfolio is a must. 
This is showcase of my projects with some detailed info about me.
Main aim is to give clients or employers an insight in my designs and codes with a final goal to contact me for my services or a job offer.

Biggest challenge was a unique design that would represent me as a brand.

## Design ##

In this portfolio, I challenged myself as a designer and made all icons in AdobeIllustrator, together with my unique logo that represents initials EM with brackets around as I am a web developer.
Also, I created images for my work section in Adobe Photoshop, made some changes on a background photo.
Website has a form of non-scrollable as I personally do not like to scroll, so I choose to made a simple navigation through four pages.
Some basics of User Experience are present especially in mobile version of the website, so I made buttons accessible and content very simple.
Regarding User Interface, I made sure contrast is present between fonts and background. Background is related to the topic of the website.
Website has its colour scheme, and it is not overloaded with content.

## Code ##

For the first time, I used SASS as a preprocessor for CSS and it helped me to organize my code and manage media queries more easily.
jQuery code is slightly complex with loads of "on click" events.
I thought of improving it as soon as I get to know basic ES6.
I did some SEO research so I added few components to make it more optimised.
